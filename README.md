# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to examine a large dataset and construct a classifier to predict credit risk. A total of 6 approaches have been evaluated in order to maximize classifier efficiency.

## Results
A total of 6 machine learning models were created and evaluated:

* <b>Logistic Regression with Naive Random Oversampling</b>
